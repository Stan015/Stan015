👋 Hi, I’m Stanley Azi, a Computer Engineering undergraduate.

💡 Fun fact: I'm also a Frontend Engineering Student in the [School of Engineering](https://engineering.altschoolafrica.com/) at AltSchool Africa.

👀 I walk through the path that leads to expert Frontend Development. <br>
🌱 I'm currently playing around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and also learning React, Vue, TypeScript, NextJS and other relevant frameworks and libraries. My exceptional UI/graphic design skills have significantly improved navigability. <br>
😊 I’m looking for help with open source projects, hackathons, internships, and entry-level opportunities. <br>
💼 Job interests: Software Engineer, Frontend Engineer, or UI Engineer (Intern or Entry level). <br>
💞️ My primary goals are achieving projects, contributing to, and collaborating with other developers. <br>
