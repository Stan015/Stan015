👋 Hi, I’m Stanley Azi, a Computer Engineering undergraduate.

💡 Fun fact: I'm also a Frontend Engineering Student in the [School of Engineering](https://engineering.altschoolafrica.com/) at AltSchool Africa.

👀 I walk through the path that leads to expert Frontend Development.
🌱 I'm currently playing around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and learning React, Vue and other frameworks and libraries I would need. My awsome UI/Graphic design skills has made the run quite navigable.
😊 I’m looking for help with open source projects, hackathons, internships, and entry-level opportunities.
💼 Job interests: Software Engineer, Frontend Engineer, or UI Engineer (Intern or Junior level).
💞️ Achieving projects, contributing and collaborating with other developers out here are my primary goals.
